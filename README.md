# Trinary-Tree-Asgmt
Assinment practicing tree data-structure, generic coding and modularity.

SUMMARY:
This program demonstrates a tracking on meetings and interactions among a family, and knowing who needs to be quarantined if someone was found positive to COVID-19.
The way of keeping track is by using a trinary tree, as each person can meet up to 4 people. 
The purpose of this assignment is to practice the use of tree data-structure, and modular programming.
There are several cases needed to be taken care of and these are the instructions and tasks for the program:

1) Creating a family - creating the tree
2) Record new appointment:
  Creating a new person and add it to the family (tree) acoording to the person he met. Each person has a unique ID, and a name.
3) Printing the tree:
  3.1) Pre-Order
  3.2) Left-Order
  3.3) BFS: 
    Printing BFS methos using a Queue
4) Quarantine - getting an ID of a person and put his close interactions into quarantine.
5) superspreder - getting an ID of a person and put all his sub-tree into qurantine.
6) Vaccine - one person got vaccinated, so all his sub-tree is has 'survived' the panademic and needs to be deleted from the tracking.
